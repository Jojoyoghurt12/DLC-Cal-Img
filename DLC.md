# Deeplabcut Tips & Tricks

Firstly, it is recommended to read up on the usage of DeepLabCut directly from their own [**Beginner's Guide**](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/docs/beginner-guides/beginners-guide.md). 
They did a phenomenal job explaining how to get started and share all of their own insights as well, in their [**./docs**](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/tree/main/docs) section. This also includes a [**interactive course**](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/docs/course.md) on how to use their software. 

> [!Tip]
> Youtube is also a great source of information for  visual explanations. For more niche cases, stackoverflow and similar coding forums, are the way to go. There is a large community of people available to answer your specific questions. Additionally, I'm available at j.ten.broeke.1@student.rug.nl for any questions you might have. 

## Hábrók
For training on the Hábrók GPU Tower at the RUG, for which you can find the link to its dashboard [**here**](https://portal.hb.hpc.rug.nl/pun/sys/dashboard). You will need permission from the University to access its services through your personal RUG-account, a link to that page can be found [**here**](https://iris.service.rug.nl/). 

> [!NOTE]
> There exists a [**Hábrók Wiki**](https://wiki.hpc.rug.nl/habrok/) which covers a lot more on the usage of all sorts of services, so its highly recommended you give it a try.

After having been granted access, and opening the dashboard you will be presented with the following GUI;

After scrolling down a bit you will find the following **App list**;

Here you can find all the possible environments you can set up. 
> [!TIP] DLC does have a preexisting [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/examples/JUPYTER/Demo_yourowndata.ipynb), for a quick start and a hands-on experience. You can run this in the above shown Jupyter tab. 

When running straight from code, use the VS code Server option.
